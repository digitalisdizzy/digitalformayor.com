        <p>Hello!</p>
  <p>
    I am <strong>Digital</strong>, and I am currently campaigning to become Mayor of Springfield.
    This role is one that requires strength, determination, hope and, most of all, an understanding of the people.
    I have all of those qualities, and here's why I think you should vote for me to become Mayor.
  </p>

  <p>First of all, here's what I plan to do.</p>

  <h2>Law Enforcement Reform</h2>
  <p>
    For too long our town has been riddled with <strong>rampant crime</strong> and <strong>murder</strong>.
    People no longer feel safe on our own streets.
    This is why, as Mayor, I will <strong>reform our law enforcement</strong>, holding them accountable for failing to stop preventable crime.
  </p>
  <p>
    Law enforcement will be given more specific orders on how to patrol, prevent crime, stop crime, pursue suspects, and
    (if necessary) use lethal force against dangerous criminals.
    They will also be more highly punished for committing <strong>injustices to our citizens</strong>,
    ensuring a fair trial and life for <strong>ALL citizens and visitors of Springfield.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Accessible Legal System</h2>
  <p>
    Our legal system is <strong>outdated</strong> and <strong>hard to understand</strong>.
    As Mayor, I will change how the legal system and processes are handled, letting <strong>anyone</strong> use our system,
    making sure that <strong>everybody</strong> has the same opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will make it easier and clearer to <strong>file lawsuits, make anonymous tips, report injustice,</strong> and much more.
    This will make our legal and justice system more robust and make our town <strong>fairer for all.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Democracy and Transparency</h2>
  <p>
    As Mayor, my council will hold <strong>frequent meetings, open to all,</strong> where we will discuss our future plans and hear <strong>your</strong> voice.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will also introduce <strong>Freedom of Information Act requests</strong> to all, allowing <em>anybody</em> to ask for information about the town, quickly and easily.
  </p>

  <h2>Why you should vote Digital</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a man for the <strong>people.</strong> I'm not trying to fill my pockets with your money.
    I'm trying to make <em>genuine</em> changes to the town.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have fought hard for this town for over a year now.
    I was the one that campaigned for these votes to come back.
    I was the one who called for the impeachment of unfit mayors.
    Now, I ask you to make me the one to change this town for the better.
  </p>

  <p>Signed,<br><em>Digital</em></p>
